## Demo

[https:/jude.flative.io](https:/jude.flative.io)



## Features

🔥 Basic features as music player are supported, **even remotly!** (standalone mode also supported) 

- Use YouTube API (iFrame Player)
- Add a song to playlist
- Remove a song from playlist
- Shuffle
- Repeat
- Prev / Next




## Purpose

1. We have a speaker that is connected with public laptop in the office
2. We have to do the journey if we want to control the music player (4~5M, distance)
3. So our music player (YouTube Website) has never been controlled
4. And basically it plays a video with autoplay feature with some ads as well..



## Get Started

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Flative/jude.git
$ cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
$ cd backend && go run *.go
```

You might need to read [this documentation](https://github.com/Flative/jude/blob/master/backend/docs/run.md) if you are not friendly with Go environment
