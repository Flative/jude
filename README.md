## Purpose

We have a speaker that is connected with public laptop in the office. If we want to control the music player, we have to do the journey (4~5m). So our music player (YouTube Website) has never been controlled and basically it plays a video with autoplay feature. with some ads as well...



## Features

- Use YouTube API (iFrame Player)
- Add a song to playlist
- Remove a song from playlist
- Shuffle
- Repeat
- Prev / Next

ðŸ”¥ Basic features as music player are supported, **even remotly!**

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Flative/jude.git

$ cd backend && go run *.go
```

You might need to read [this documentation](https://github.com/Flative/jude/blob/master/backend/docs/run.md) if you are not friendly with Go environment
